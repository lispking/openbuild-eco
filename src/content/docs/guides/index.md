Hello there, fellow interested in OpenBuild! ðŸ‘‹

If this is your first time here and you're not quite familiar with OpenBuild, you might be curious about what the "OpenBuild Ecosystem" is, how it relates to the OpenBuild official website, and what connection it has with OpenBuild itself.

You've come to the right place! The purpose of this document is to help you understand what they are and how they are connected.

## Understanding "OpenBuild"

What is "OpenBuild"? From a positioning perspective, it is:

> An open-source community bridging Web2 to Web3, connecting builders and businesses, and empowering them to succeed!

Breaking it down literally.

"OpenBuild" is an "open-source community" with the mission to:

- Help developers still in Web2 transition smoothly to Web3;
- Connect (independent) developers with businesses;
- Empower and assist (independent) developers in achieving success.

It can be seen that the description above is more conceptual and abstract; what will be discussed next is more practical, a set of systems put into practice, mainly consisting of the official website, ecosystem, and partners.

### Official Website

By visiting the URL [OpenBuild.xyz](https://openbuild.xyz/), you will arrive at the OpenBuild official website. This can be considered the entry point for everyone to start understanding and engaging with the "OpenBuild System", and it is the facade of "OpenBuild".

The main theme of the official website is "Learning" and "Interaction", helping Web2 developers transition to Web3 through a variety of courses and activities, while also allowing Web3 developers to keep up with the latest technologies and projects.

The official website, as a digital product, shapes the brand image and bears the responsibility of giving developers a tangible sense of the path "from learning to earning".

### Ecosystem

Projects produced based on the collaboration system on GitHub have formed an ecosystem centered around "OpenBuild"; most of these projects are open-source and meet the condition of "mutual benefit between project initiators and OpenBuild".

It can be seen that the theme of the OpenBuild Ecosystem is:

- **[Co-building](/eco/guides/how-to-contribute/)**â€”either becoming stronger through project practice with others, or jointly creating products for ideas you believe in;
- **Incubation**â€”your own projects need help from OpenBuild and can give back to OpenBuild's efforts in some way.

This is not only another entrance to the world of the "OpenBuild System" but also complements the official website, serving as a powerful backing force behind its development!

### Partners

Communities and media that can provide support in content and traffic, as well as project parties that can sponsor financially.

## Join "OpenBuild"

As mentioned above, "OpenBuild" is an "open-source community".

For healthy and sustainable development, it inevitably requires a relatively stable core team to invest a lot of time and effort in promoting various matters.

Therefore, the "organization" of "OpenBuild" is composed of the core team and ecosystem builders.

You can imagine a circle, with the center being the relatively stable core team in terms of personnel and numbers, and the outside being the more flexible and expanding ecosystem builders.

"OpenBuild" is a decentralized organization that encourages everyone to propose and implement their own ideas.

We welcome you to join us as an ecosystem builder!
